baghchaal
=========

a third or so attempt at making this simple game. first was console based in C
and then it was C with raylib which was nothing burger. the last one was Lua
with Love 2d
(see <https://github.com/sudanchapagain/x/blob/main/general_purpose/z_misc/lua/baghchal/main.lua>)

## note to self

research about libraries. considerations: sokol, raylib, sdl, no abstraction libs (direct opengl or other?)

maybe rust and raylib?
